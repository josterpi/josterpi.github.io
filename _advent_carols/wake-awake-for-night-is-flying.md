title: Wake, Awake, for Night is Flying
---
1. "Wake, awake, for night is flying,"  
The watchmen on the heights are crying;  
"Awake, Jerusalem, arise!"  
Midnight hears the welcome voices  
And at the thrilling cry rejoices:  
"Oh, where are ye, ye virgins wise?  
The Bridegroom comes, awake!  
Your lamps with gladness take!  
Hallelujah!  
With bridal care Yourselves prepare  
To meet the Bridegroom, who is near."

2. Zion hears the watchmen singing,  
And all her heart with joy is springing,  
She wakes, she rises from her gloom;  
For her Lord comes down all-glorious,  
The strong in grace, in truth victorious,  
Her Star is ris'n, her Light is come.  
"Now come, Thou Blessed One,  
Lord Jesus, God's own Son,  
Hail! Hosanna!  
The joyful call We answer all  
And follow to the nuptial hall."

3. Now let all the heav'ns adore Thee,  
Let men and angels sing before Thee,  
With harp and cymbal's clearest tone.  
Of one pearl each shining portal,  
Where, dwelling with the choir immortal,  
We gather round Thy radiant throne.  
No vision ever brought,  
No ear hath ever caught,  
Such great glory;  
Therefore will we Eternally  
Sing hymns of praise and joy to Thee.
