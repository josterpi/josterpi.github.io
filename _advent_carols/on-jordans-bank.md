title: On Jordan's Bank
---
1. On Jordan’s bank the Baptist’s cry  
Announces that the Lord is nigh;  
Come, then, and hearken, for he brings  
Glad tidings from the King of kings!

2. Then cleansed be ev’ry soul from sin;  
Make straight the way for God within;  
Prepare we in our hearts a home,  
Where such a mighty Guest may come.

3. For Thou art our salvation, Lord,  
Our Refuge and our great reward.  
Without Thy grace our souls must fade  
And wither like a flow’r decayed.

4. Stretch forth Thine hand, to heal our sore,  
And make us rise and fall no more;  
Once more upon Thy people shine,  
And fill the world with love divine.

5. All praise, eternal Son, to Thee,  
Whose advent doth Thy people free,  
Whom with the Father, we adore,  
And Holy Ghost, for evermore.
