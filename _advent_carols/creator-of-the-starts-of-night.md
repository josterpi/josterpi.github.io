title: Creator of the Stars of Night

1. Creator of the stars of night,  
Thy people’s everlasting Light;  
Jesu, Redeemer, save us all,  
And hear thy servants when they call.
  
2. Thou, grieving that the ancient curse  
Should doom to death a universe,  
Hast found the med’cine, full of grace,  
To save and heal a ruin’d race.

3. Thou cam’st, the Bridegroom of the bride,  
As drew the world to eveningtide;  
Proceeding from a virgin shrine,  
The spotless Victim all divine.

4. At Whose dread Name, majestic now,  
All knees must bend, all hearts must bow;  
And things celestial Thee shall own,  
And things terrestrial, Lord alone.

5. O Thou, Whose coming is with dread  
To judge and doom the quick and dead,  
Preserve us, while we dwell below,  
From ev’ry insult of the foe.
