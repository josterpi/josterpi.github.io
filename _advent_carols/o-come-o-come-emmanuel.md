title: O Come, O Come, Emmanuel

1. O come, O come, Emmanuel,  
And ransom captive Israel,  
That mourns in lonely exile here  
Until the Son of God appear.  
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee, O Israel.
  
2. O come, O Wisdom from on high,  
embracing all things far and nigh:  
in strength and beauty come and stay;  
teach us your will and guide our way.  
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee, O Israel.
  
3. O come, O come, Thou Lord of might,  
Who to Thy tribes, on Sinai’s height,  
In ancient times didst give the Law,  
In cloud, and majesty and awe.  
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee, O Israel.
  
4. O come, Thou Rod of Jesse, free  
Thine own from Satan’s tyranny;  
From depths of hell Thy people save,  
And give them vict’ry o’er the grave.  
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee, O Israel.
  
5. O come, Thou Key of David, come,  
And open wide our heav’nly home;  
Make safe the way that leads on high,  
And close the path to misery.  
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee, O Israel.
  
6. O come, Thou Dayspring, come and cheer  
Our spirits by Thine advent here;  
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night,  
And death’s dark shadows put to flight.  
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee, O Israel.
  
7. O come, O King of nations, come,  
O Cornerstone that binds in one:  
refresh the hearts that long for you;  
restore the broken, make us new.  
Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel  
Shall come to thee, O Israel.
