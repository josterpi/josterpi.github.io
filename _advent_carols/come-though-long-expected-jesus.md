title: Come Thou Long Expected Jesus
---
1. Come, Thou long expected Jesus,  
born to set Thy people free;  
from our fears and sins release us,  
let us find our rest in Thee.
  
2. Israel’s strength and consolation,  
hope of all the earth Thou art:  
dear desire of ev’ry nation,  
joy of ev’ry longing heart.
  
3. Born Thy people to deliver,  
born a child, and yet a king,  
born to reign in us for ever,  
now Thy gracious kingdom bring.

4. By Thine own eternal Spirit  
rule in all our hearts alone;  
by Thy grace, help us to merit  
life eternal at Thy throne.
