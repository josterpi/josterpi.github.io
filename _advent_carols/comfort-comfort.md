title: Comfort, Comfort now my People
---
1. "Comfort, comfort now my people;  
tell of peace!" so says our God.  
Comfort those who sit in darkness  
mourning under sorrow's load.  
To God's people now proclaim  
that God's pardon waits for them!  
Tell them that their war is over;  
God will reign in peace forever!

2. For the herald's voice is crying  
in the desert far and near,  
calling us to true repentance  
since the Kingdom now is here.  
Oh, that warning cry obey!  
Now prepare for God a way!  
Let the valleys rise to meet him,  
and the hills bow down to greet him!

3. Straight shall be what long was crooked,  
and the rougher places plain!  
Let your hearts be true and humble,  
as befits his holy reign!  
For the glory of the Lord  
now on earth is shed abroad,  
and all flesh shall see the token  
that God's word is never broken.
