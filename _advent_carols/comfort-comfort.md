title: Comfort, Comfort ye my People
---
1. Comfort, comfort ye my people,  
speak ye peace, thus saith our God;  
comfort those who sit in darkness,  
mourning 'neath their sorrow's load.  
Speak ye to Jerusalem  
of the peace that waits for them;  
tell her that her sins I cover,  
and her warfare now is over.

2. Yea, her sins our God will pardon,  
blotting out each dark misdeed;  
all that well deserved his anger  
he no more will see or heed.  
She hath suffered many a day,  
now her griefs have passed away;  
God will change her pining sadness  
into ever-springing gladness.

3. For the herald's voice is crying  
in the desert far and near,  
bidding all men to repentance,  
since the kingdom now is here.  
O that warning cry obey!  
Now prepare for God a way;  
let the valleys rise to meet him,  
and the hills bow down to greet him.

4. Make ye straight what long was crooked,  
make the rougher places plain;  
let your hearts be true and humble,  
as befits his holy reign.  
For the glory of the Lord  
now o'er earth is shed abroad;  
and all flesh shall see the token,  
that his word is never broken.
