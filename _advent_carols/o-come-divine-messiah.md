title: O Come, Divine Messiah
---
1. O come, divine Messiah!  
The world in silence waits the day  
When hope shall sing its triumph,  
And sadness flee away.

   Dear Savior, haste! Come, come to earth.  
Dispel the night and show your face,  
And bid us hail the dawn of grace.  
O come, Divine Messiah!  
The world in silence waits the day  
When hope shall sing its triumph,  
And sadness flee away.

2. O come, Desired of nations,  
Whom priest and prophet long foretold.  
Come break the captive's fetters,  
Redeem the long-lost fold.

   Dear Savior, haste! Come, come to earth.  
Dispel the night and show your face,  
And bid us hail the dawn of grace.  
O come, Divine Messiah!  
The world in silence waits the day  
When hope shall sing its triumph,  
And sadness flee away.

3. O come in peace and meekness,  
For lowly will your cradle be:  
Though clothed in human weakness  
We shall your Godhead see.  

   Dear Savior, haste! Come, come to earth.  
Dispel the night and show your face,  
And bid us hail the dawn of grace.  
O come, Divine Messiah!  
The world in silence waits the day  
When hope shall sing its triumph,  
And sadness flee away.
