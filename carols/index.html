	<li>Joy to the world, the Lord is come;<br>
	  Let earth receive her King;<br>
	  Let every heart prepare Him room,<br>
	  And heaven and nature sing,<br>
	  And heaven and nature sing,<br>
	  And heaven, and heaven and nature sing.</li>

	<li>Joy to the earth, the Savior reigns;<br>
	  Let men their songs employ;<br>
	  While fields and floods,<br>
	  Rocks, hills and plains<br>
	  Repeat the sounding joy,<br>
	  Repeat the sounding joy,<br>
	  Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.</li>
	
	<li>No more let sins and sorrows grow,<br>
	  Nor thorns infest the ground;<br>
	  He comes to make His blessing flow<br>
	  Far as the curse is found,<br>
	  Far as the curse is found,<br>
	  Far as, far as the curse is found.</li>

	<li>He rules the world with truth and grace,<br>
	  And makes the nations prove<br>
	  The glories of His righteousness,<br>
	  And wonders of His love,<br>
	  And wonders of His love,<br>
	  And wonders, wonders of His love.</li>

      <h1>Angels We Have Heard On High</h1>
      <ol class="lyrics">
	<li>
	  Angels we have heard on high<br>
	  Sweetly singing o'er the plains,<br>
	  And the mountains in reply<br>
	  Echoing their joyous strains.<br>
	  Gloria, in excelsis Deo!<br>
	  Gloria, in excelsis Deo!</li>

	<li>
	  Shepherds, why this jubilee?<br>
	  Why your joyous strains prolong?<br>
	  What the gladsome tidings be<br>
	  Which inspire your heavenly song?<br>
	  Gloria, in excelsis Deo!<br>
	  Gloria, in excelsis Deo!</li>

	<li>
	  Come to Bethlehem and see<br>
	  Him whose birth the angels sing;<br>
	  Come, adore on bended knee,<br>
	  Christ the Lord, the newborn King.<br>
	  Gloria, in excelsis Deo!<br>
	  Gloria, in excelsis Deo!</li>

	<li>
	  See Him in a manger laid,<br>
	  Whom the choirs of angels praise;<br>
	  Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,<br>
	  While our hearts in love we raise.<br>
	  Gloria, in excelsis Deo!<br>
	  Gloria, in excelsis Deo!</li>

      <h1>God Rest You, Merry Gentlemen</h1>
      <ol class="lyrics">
	<li>
	  God rest you merry, gentlemen,<br>
	  Let nothing you dismay.<br>
	  For Jesus Christ our Savior,<br>
	  Was born on Christmas Day;<br>
	  To save us all from Satan's power,<br>
	  When we were gone astray.<br>

	  <br>
	  O tidings of comfort and joy,<br>
	  For Jesus Christ our Savior<br>
	  Was born on Christmas day.<br></li>

	<li>
	  In Bethlehem, in Jury,<br>
	  This blessed Babe was born,<br>
	  And laid within a manger,<br>
	  Upon this blessed morn;<br>
	  The which His mother Mary<br>
	  Did nothing take in scorn.<br>

	  <br>
	  O tidings of comfort and joy,<br>
	  For Jesus Christ our Savior<br>
	  Was born on Christmas day.<br></li>

	<li>
	  From God our heavenly Father,<br>
	  A blessed angel came.<br>
	  And unto certain shepherds,<br>
	  Brought tidings of the same,<br>
	  How that in Bethlehem was born,<br>
	  The Son of God by name:<br>

	  <br>
	  O tidings of comfort and joy,<br>
	  For Jesus Christ our Savior<br>
	  Was born on Christmas day.<br></li>

	<li>
	  Fear not, then said the angel,<br>
	  Let nothing you affright,<br>
	  This day is born a Savior,<br>
	  Of virtue, power, and might;<br>
	  So frequently to vanquish all,<br>
	  The friends of Satan quite;<br>

	  <br>
	  O tidings of comfort and joy,<br>
	  For Jesus Christ our Savior<br>
	  Was born on Christmas day.<br></li>

	<li>
	  The shepherds at those tidings,<br>
	  Rejoiced much in mind,<br>
	  And left their flocks a feeding,<br>
	  In tempest, storm, and wind,<br>
	  And went to Bethlehem straightway,<br>
	  This blessed Babe to find:<br>

	  <br>
	  O tidings of comfort and joy,<br>
	  For Jesus Christ our Savior<br>
	  Was born on Christmas day.<br></li>

	<li>
	  But when to Bethlehem they came,<br>
	  Whereas this Infant lay<br>
	  They found him in a manger,<br>
	  Where oxen feed on hay;<br>
	  His mother Mary kneeling,<br>
	  Unto the Lord did pray:<br>

	  <br>
	  O tidings of comfort and joy,<br>
	  For Jesus Christ our Savior<br>
	  Was born on Christmas day.<br></li>

	<li>
	  With sudden joy and gladness<br>
	  The shepherds were beguiled,<br>
	  To see the Babe of Israel,<br>
	  Before His mother mild,<br>
	  O then with joy and cheerfulnes<br>
	  Rejoice, each mother's child.<br>

	  <br>
	  O tidings of comfort and joy,<br>
	  For Jesus Christ our Savior<br>
	  Was born on Christmas day.<br></li>

	<li>
	  Now to the Lord sing praises,<br>
	  All you within this place,<br>
	  And with true love and brotherhood,<br>
	  Each other now embrace;<br>
	  This holy tide of Christmas,<br>
	  Doth bring redeeming grace.<br>

	  <br>
	  O tidings of comfort and joy,<br>
	  For Jesus Christ our Savior<br>
	  Was born on Christmas day.<br></li>

	<li>
	  God bless the ruler of this house<br>
	  And send him long to reign,<br>
	  And many a merry Christmas<br>
	  May live to see again;<br>
	  Among your friends and kindred<br>
	  That live both far and near.<br>

	  <br>
	  O tidings of comfort and joy,<br>
	  For Jesus Christ our Savior<br>
	  Was born on Christmas day.<br></li>
