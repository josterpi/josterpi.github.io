title: Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming
---
1. Lo, how a rose e'er blooming,  
From tender stem hath sprung!  
From Jesse's lineage coming,  
As men of old have sung.  
It came, a floweret bright,  
Amid the cold of winter  
When half spent was the night.

2. Isaiah 'twas foretold it,  
The Rose I have in mind  
With Mary we behold it,  
The Virgin mother kind.  
To show God's love aright,  
She bore to us a Savior  
When half spent was the night.  

3. The shepherds heard the story  
Proclaimed by angels bright,  
How Christ, the Lord of Glory  
Was born on earth this night.  
To Bethlehem they sped  
And in the manger found Him,  
As angels heralds said.  

4. This Flower, whose fragrance tender  
With sweetness fills the air,  
Dispels with glorious splendor  
The darkness everywhere;  
True man, yet very God,  
From sin and death he saves us,  
And lightens every load.
