title: God Rest You, Merry Gentlemen
---

1. God rest you merry, gentlemen,  
Let nothing you dismay.  
For Jesus Christ our Savior,  
Was born on Christmas Day;  
To save us all from Satan's power,  
When we were gone astray.  
O tidings of comfort and joy,  
For Jesus Christ our Savior  
Was born on Christmas day.  

2. In Bethlehem, in Jury,  
This blessed Babe was born,  
And laid within a manger,  
Upon this blessed morn;  
The which His mother Mary  
Did nothing take in scorn.  
O tidings of comfort and joy,  
For Jesus Christ our Savior  
Was born on Christmas day.  

3. From God our heavenly Father,  
A blessed angel came.  
And unto certain shepherds,  
Brought tidings of the same,  
How that in Bethlehem was born,  
The Son of God by name:  
O tidings of comfort and joy,  
For Jesus Christ our Savior  
Was born on Christmas day.  

4. Fear not, then said the angel,  
Let nothing you affright,  
This day is born a Savior,  
Of virtue, power, and might;  
So frequently to vanquish all,  
The friends of Satan quite;  
O tidings of comfort and joy,  
For Jesus Christ our Savior  
Was born on Christmas day.  

5. The shepherds at those tidings,  
Rejoiced much in mind,  
And left their flocks a feeding,  
In tempest, storm, and wind,  
And went to Bethlehem straightway,  
This blessed Babe to find:  
O tidings of comfort and joy,  
For Jesus Christ our Savior  
Was born on Christmas day.  

6. But when to Bethlehem they came,  
Whereas this Infant lay  
They found him in a manger,  
Where oxen feed on hay;  
His mother Mary kneeling,  
Unto the Lord did pray:  
O tidings of comfort and joy,  
For Jesus Christ our Savior  
Was born on Christmas day.  

7. With sudden joy and gladness  
The shepherds were beguiled,  
To see the Babe of Israel,  
Before His mother mild,  
O then with joy and cheerfulnes  
Rejoice, each mother's child.  
O tidings of comfort and joy,  
For Jesus Christ our Savior  
Was born on Christmas day.  

8. Now to the Lord sing praises,  
All you within this place,  
And with true love and brotherhood,  
Each other now embrace;  
This holy tide of Christmas,  
Doth bring redeeming grace.  
O tidings of comfort and joy,  
For Jesus Christ our Savior  
Was born on Christmas day.  

9. God bless the ruler of this house  
And send him long to reign,  
And many a merry Christmas  
May live to see again;  
Among your friends and kindred  
That live both far and near.  
O tidings of comfort and joy,  
For Jesus Christ our Savior  
Was born on Christmas day.
