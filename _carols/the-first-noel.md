title: The First Nowell
---
1. The first Nowell the Angel did say  
Was to three poor Shepherds in fields as they lay.  
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,  
In a cold winter's night that was so deep.  
Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell,  
Born is the King of Israel.  

2. They looked up and saw a star  
Shining in the East, beyond them far,  
And to the earth it gave great light,  
And so it continued, both day and night.  
Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell,  
Born is the King of Israel.  

3. And by the light of that same star  
Three wise men came from country far,  
To seek for a King was their intent,  
And to follow the star wherever it went.  
Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell,  
Born is the King of Israel.  

4. This star drew nigh to the North West;  
O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest.  
And there it did both stop and stay,  
Right over the place where Jesus lay.  
Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell,  
Born is the King of Israel.  

5. Then did they know assuredly  
Within that house, the King did lie  
One entered in then for to see  
And found the babe in poverty.  
Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell,  
Born is the King of Israel.  

6. Then enter'd in those wise men three,  
Full reverently upon their knee,  
And offer'd there, in his presence,  
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.  
Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell,  
Born is the King of Israel.  

7. Between an ox stall and an ass,  
This Child truly there born he was;  
For want of clothing they did him lay  
All in a manger, among the hay.  
Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell,  
Born is the King of Israel.  

8. Then let us all with one accord  
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord;  
That hath made heaven and earth of nought,  
And with his blood mankind hath bought.  
Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell,  
Born is the King of Israel.  

9. If we in our time shall do well  
We shall be free from death and Hell  
For God hath prepared for us all  
A resting place in general.  
Nowell, nowell, nowell, nowell,  
Born is the King of Israel.
