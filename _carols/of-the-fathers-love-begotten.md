title: Of the Father's Love Begotten
---
1. Of the Father's love begotten  
Ere the worlds began to be,  
He is Alpha and Omega,  
He the Source, the Ending He,  
Of the things that are, that have been,  
And that future years shall see  
Evermore and evermore.

2. Oh, that birth forever blessed  
When the Virgin, full of grace,  
By the Holy Ghost conceiving,  
Bare the Savior of our race,  
And the Babe, the world's Redeemer,  
First revealed His sacred face  
Evermore and evermore.

3. O ye heights of heaven, adore Him;  
Angel hosts, His praises sing;  
Powers, dominions, bow before Him  
And extol our God and King.  
Let no tongue on earth be silent,  
Every voice in concert ring  
Evermore and evermore.

4. This is He whom Heaven-taught singers  
Sang of old with one accord;  
Whom the Scriptures of the prophets  
Promised in their faithful word.  
Now He shines, the Long-expected;  
Let creation praise its Lord  
Evermore and evermore.

5. Christ, to Thee, with God the Father,  
And, O Holy Ghost, to Thee  
Hymn and chant and high thanksgiving  
And unending praises be,  
Honor, glory, and dominion,  
And eternal victory  
Evermore and evermore.
