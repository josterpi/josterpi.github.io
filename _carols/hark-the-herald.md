title: Hark! The Herald Angels Sing
---
1. Hark! the herald angels sing,  
"Glory to the new-born King!  
Peace on earth, and mercy mild;  
God and sinners reconciled."  
Joyful all ye nations, rise;  
Join the triumph of the skies;  
With th' angelic hosts proclaim,  
"Christ is born in Bethlehem."  
Hark the herald angels sing,  
Glory to the new-born King.  

2. Christ, by highest heav'n adored;  
Christ, the everlasting Lord;  
Late in time behold Him come,  
Offspring of the Virgin's womb.  
Veil'd in flesh the Godhead see;  
Hail, the incarnate Deity,  
Pleased as man with man to dwell,  
Jesus, our Emmanuel!  
Hark the herald angels sing,  
Glory to the new-born King.  

3. Hail, the heaven-born Prince of Peace!  
Hail, the Son of Righteousness!  
Light and life to all He brings,  
Risen with healing in His wings,  
Mild He lays His glory by,  
Born that man no more may die,  
Born to raise the sons of earth,  
Born to give them second birth.  
Hark the herald angels sing,  
Glory to the new-born King.
