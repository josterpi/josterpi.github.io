title: Hark! The Herald Angels Sing
---
1. Hark! the herald angels sing  
Glory to the new-born King!  
Peace on earth and mercy mild,  
God and sinners reconciled!  
Joyful, all ye nations, rise,  
Join the triumph of the skies;  
With th' angelic host proclaim  
Christ is born in Bethlehem!  
Hark! the herald angels sing  
Glory to the new-born King!  

2. Christ, by highest heaven adored;  
Christ, the everlasting Lord;  
Late in time behold Him come,  
Offspring of the Virgin's womb.  
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;  
Hail, the incarnate Deity,  
Pleased as man with man to dwell;  
Jesus, our Emmanuel!  
Hark! the herald angels sing  
Glory to the new-born King!  

3. Hail, the heaven-born Prince of Peace!  
Hail, the Son of Righteousness!  
Light and life to all He brings,  
Risen with healing in His wings,  
Mild He lays His glory by,  
Born that man no more may die,  
Born to raise the sons of earth,  
Born to give them second birth.  
Hark! the herald angels sing  
Glory to the new-born King!  

4. Come, Desire of nations come,  
Fix in us Thy humble home;  
Rise, the Woman's conquering Seed,  
Bruise in us the Serpent's head.  
Adam's likeness now efface:  
Stamp Thine image in its place;  
Second Adam, from above,  
Reinstate us in Thy love.  
Hark! the herald angels sing  
Glory to the new-born King!
