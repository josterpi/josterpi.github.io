1. O Come all Ye Faithful  
Joyful and triumphant,  
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.  
Come and behold Him,  
Born the King of angels:

   O come, let us adore Him,  
O come, let us adore Him,  
O come, let us adore Him,  
Christ the Lord:

2. God from God,  
Light from Light  
Lo, he abhors not the virgin's womb;  
Very God,  
begotten not created:

   O come, let us adore Him,  
O come, let us adore Him,  
O come, let us adore Him,  
Christ the Lord:

3. Sing, choirs of angels,  
Sing in exultation,  
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above.  
Glory to God, In the highest:

   O come, let us adore Him,  
O come, let us adore Him,  
O come, let us adore Him,  
Christ the Lord.

4. Yea, Lord, we greet Thee,  
Born this happy morning,  
Jesus, to thee be all glory giv'n!
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing:

   O come, let us adore Him,  
O come, let us adore Him,  
O come, let us adore Him,  
Christ the Lord.
