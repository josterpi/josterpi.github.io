Figured it was time to make a web site. Here it is. Lots of work to do on it.

**A work in progress...**

### About me

 - [I'm getting married to Anne Swan!](http://anne-jeremy.osterhouse.org/)
 - Here is my [resume](/resume.pdf)
 - [One:Ten profile](http://onetencommunications.com/about/#jeremy-osterhouse)

### Where I am

- <a rel="me" href="http://flickr.com/photos/josterpi/">Flickr</a>
- <a rel="me" href="http://twitter.com/josterpi">Twitter</a>
- <a rel="me" href="https://github.com/josterpi/">Github</a>

### Small Websites

 - [Pomodoro timer](pomodoro/) is unlike any other online timer I've seen on the internet. It's not a digital countdown, blinking at me every second, but is more like an analog kitchen timer
 - [Time Log](timelog/) is a super low effort way to keep track of your time. It stores all of the data on your local computer, so there's no account needed and you have complete privacy
 - [GasCalc](gascalc/) is a minimalist gas cost calculator. Fill in three of MPG, price of gas, miles, and total cost and solve for the final variable.
 - [Christmas Carols](carols/) is a mobile-optimized Christmas carol songbook that has all of the carols that I want to sing in one place and skips the 75 carols that I'm not interested in.

### Other stuff

 - I moved this web site to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/): [josterpi.github.io](https://github.com/josterpi/josterpi.github.io)
 - I typeset my resume with LaTeX. Here are some <a href="/latex-notes.html">notes</a> on LaTeX.
 - <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> is my editor of choice and <a href="vim-tips.html">here</a> are some tips that I've been putting together for a while.
 - I am presently spending a lot of time working with <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> and having a blast.
 - I worked on <a href="http://www.chipmark.com/">Chipmark</a> during the 2005-2006 school year
 - I've been working with <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> since 2004 and I know it pretty well. Most times, the code is a real pleasure to work with.
 - I developed <a href="http://www.peopleofpraise.org">www.peopleofpraise.org</a> using Drupal for the People of Praise.
 - I put together <a href="http://www.citybuilder.org">www.citybuilder.org</a> using Drupal for the People of Praise and one:ten.
 - Spring of 2004 I put together <a href="/webtech.html">this</a> introduction to the web development. It kind of trailed off as I ran out of time.

 - To Do: Add more content, make it look good, ...

This quote from Fred P. Brooks essay "The Tar Pit" is the closest I've found to summing up why I love computer science:

<cite>"Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.</cite>

<cite>"Yet, the program contruct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works. Producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be."</cite>
