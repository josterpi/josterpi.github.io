## Pomodoro Timer

a simple pomodoro timer.

Main feature: it doesn't blink at you every second.

Hover over timer to see precise time.

Click if you want it to always show the exact time.

Visual alarm at the end of the timer.

Counts up after it expires.

I run it like this: google-chrome --app=https://josterpi.com/pomodoro/
